const STAGE2_DECISION_CAPTURE_PROMPT =
`I just finished a Constraint and Scope conversation with an AI tool. Please summarize the key decisions we made during this conversation.

Format your response as a simple flat numbered list. One decision per line. Each line should state the decision and the reason for it in one sentence. No sub-bullets. No nested lists. Every item must start at the beginning of the line with its number.

Example format:
1. Limit the scope to a single user — multi-user would require authentication and data separation that adds significant complexity
2. Exclude mobile from the initial build — the primary use case is desktop and mobile adds layout and testing overhead

Only include decisions we actually settled. Do not include things that were discussed but not resolved.`;

const STAGE2_PROMPT_TEMPLATE =
`You are helping me scope a solution before I begin building it. Your job is to take my inputs, the problem context from Stage 1, and produce a structured Constraint and Scope Document.

## Project: {{projectName}}{{projectDesc}}

---

## Context from Stage 1: Problem Definition

{{stage1Context}}

---

## Stage 2 Inputs

**What any solution absolutely must do:**
{{mustHave}}

**What any solution must never do, cost, or require:**
{{mustNot}}

**My current skill level with the tools I plan to use:**
{{skills}}

**Existing tools and solutions for this problem:**
{{existingTools}}

**What those solutions do well, and where they fall short:**
{{auditResults}}

**Core features required for this to be worthwhile (MVP):**
{{mvp}}

**What a complete, finished version looks like:**
{{fullProduct}}

**What would make this genuinely best-in-class:**
{{bestInClass}}

---

Using these inputs and the Stage 1 problem context, produce a **Constraint and Scope Document** with the following sections:

**1. Hard Requirements**
A precise list of what any solution must do. Reframe my must-haves as measurable requirements where possible. If I was vague, sharpen the language without changing the intent.

**2. Hard Constraints**
A precise list of what is off the table. Include constraints surfaced in Stage 1 and any additional constraints I named here. Frame each as a design parameter, not a limitation.

**3. Skill and Resource Reality**
An honest summary of what my current skill level means for scope. What is realistic to build given what I described? What would require learning or outside help? Flag any meaningful gaps between my skill level and my stated scope.

**4. Existing Solution Landscape**
A brief summary of what already exists and what the gap is. What do existing solutions get right that I should not try to reinvent? What specifically do they fail at that my solution must address?

**5. Feature Scope: Three Tiers**

- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** The smallest version that actually solves the core problem. List the specific features that belong here. Be ruthless — if a feature does not directly address a must-have requirement, it does not belong in the MVP.

- **Complete Product:** The version you would call "done." What gets added beyond the MVP?

- **Best-in-Class:** The aspirational tier. What makes this uniquely valuable compared to everything else?

**6. Recommended MVP Definition**
Based on everything above: a concrete, specific description of the first version to build. Name the features, state what each one must do to count as working, and flag any scope items that carry significant risk given my skill level or constraints.

Write in plain, direct language. No filler. No encouragement. Treat me as capable of handling precision. If something I described in my inputs is inconsistent or unrealistic given my constraints or skill level, say so directly.`;

const STAGE2_FINALIZATION_PROMPT =
`We've been refining a Constraint and Scope Document through our conversation. Please produce the final, clean version now.

Write only the document — no preamble, no commentary, no explanation of changes.

The document must include these sections:
1. Hard Requirements
2. Hard Constraints
3. Skill and Resource Reality
4. Existing Solution Landscape
5. Feature Scope (MVP / Complete / Best-in-Class)
6. Recommended MVP Definition

Incorporate everything we discussed. Write in plain, direct language. No filler.`;
