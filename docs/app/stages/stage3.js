More detail on what I am building:
{{projectDetail}}

My comfort working in a code editor or terminal:
{{techComfort}}

What matters most to me about how this gets built:
{{priority}}

Based on this, recommend ONE of the following approaches and explain why it fits my situation:

- Chat AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini): No coding, no setup. For workflows, prompt systems, structured documents, or processes that do not require a running application.
- Vibe coding platform (Bolt, Lovable, Replit): Browser-based, no local setup. For web apps with a real interface, built without working in a terminal.
- Coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf): Works in a local code editor. For custom applications that need full control over data, logic, and architecture.
- No-code platform (Airtable, Notion, Zapier): No code at all. For structured data, automation, and workflows using existing platforms.

Name one. Explain the match in three to four sentences. If a second option is a close fit, note when I might choose it instead.`;

Format your response as a simple flat numbered list. One decision per line. Each line should state the decision and the reason for it in one sentence. No sub-bullets. No nested lists. Every item must start at the beginning of the line with its number.

Example format:
1. Use Python with Flask for the backend — lightweight, I already know Python, and this app has no real-time requirements
2. Store data in SQLite locally — no need for a server database given the single-user, local-only scope

Only include decisions we actually settled. Do not include things that were discussed but not resolved.`;
